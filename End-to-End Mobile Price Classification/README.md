In this project, I thoroughly cleaned and analyzed a mobile price dataset, examining trends and handling outliers.
I then applied advanced classification algorithms—including Decision Trees, Random Forests, KNN, and MLP—to predict price ranges with impressive accuracy. 
This work demonstrates my expertise in feature engineering, model tuning, and data visualization, illustrating the remarkable impact of a well-executed data science pipeline.
